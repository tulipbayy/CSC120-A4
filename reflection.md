- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

1. Initial Impressions of Encapsulation:
   My initial impressions of how encapsulation affects programming are positive. It helps in organizing code, reducing complexity, and improving maintainability. By encapsulating data within classes and providing access through methods, we can enforce data integrity and minimize unintended changes to the data.

2. What Worked and What Didn't:
   Overall, the assignment went smoothly, and I was able to implement the required classes and methods successfully. The step-by-step approach provided clear guidance on how to design and implement each component of the virtual train system. The use of enums, arrays, and ArrayLists helped in modeling the train system effectively. However, there were some challenges, such as ensuring proper encapsulation and managing dependencies between classes. Additionally, writing comprehensive Javadoc comments and adhering to style guidelines required attention to detail and careful consideration. Overall, the assignment was a valuable learning experience that reinforced concepts of object-oriented programming.

3. Advice for Future Students:
   For future students taking this course, I would recommend starting early and breaking down the assignment into manageable tasks. Take the time to understand the requirements and design a clear structure for your classes.
